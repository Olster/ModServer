Outdated.

Will be rewritten soon to run on both windows and unix plaforms.

Single-threaded HTTP server working on Unix sockets. Compile with ```-std=c++11``` flag for C++11 features
and ```DDEBUG``` for debug info.

PS I wanna run it on my ```Hackberry A10``` running Android, so C++ cross-compiler for ARM is a way to go.
